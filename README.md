# Mathematical and Statistical Operations Tool

## Overview

This Python tool provides a versatile solution for performing mathematical and statistical operations on both numerical and textual inputs. It is designed to handle a wide range of user queries, from evaluating mathematical expressions to computing statistical measures.

## Features

- **Mathematical Expressions**: Easily evaluate mathematical expressions, including basic arithmetic operations and more complex expressions.
- **Statistical Calculations**: Compute statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, greatest common divisor (gcd), and least common multiple (lcm) of a list of numbers.
- **Textual Input Handling**: Process textual input by identifying keywords and performing corresponding mathematical or statistical operations.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging to analyze textual input.

## Usage

1. **Evaluation of Mathematical Expressions**:
   - Input: Mathematical expressions can be provided in various formats, including standard mathematical notation and text-based expressions.
   - Output: The tool evaluates the expression and returns the result.

2. **Statistical Operations**:
   - Input: Lists of numbers or textual descriptions containing numbers and keywords (e.g., "find mean of these numbers").
   - Output: Returns the calculated statistical measures, such as mean, median, mode, gcd, or lcm.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The tool provides robust error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring smooth operation even in challenging scenarios.

## Examples

- Evaluating Mathematical Expression: `calculate('2 * (3 + 4)')`
- Calculating Mean: `calculate('find mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5')`
- Finding Mode: `calculate('mode of 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5')`
- Processing Textual Input: `calculate('What is the median of these numbers: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25')`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to enhance the functionality of the tool.
