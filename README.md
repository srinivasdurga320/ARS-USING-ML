# Mathematical and Statistical Operations Tool

## Overview

This Python tool provides a versatile solution for performing mathematical and statistical operations on both numerical and textual inputs. It is designed to handle a wide range of user queries, from evaluating mathematical expressions to computing statistical measures.

### Features

- Easily evaluate mathematical expressions
- Compute statistical measures (mean, median, mode, etc.)
- Process textual input for mathematical operations
- Utilize NLTK for natural language processing

### Usage

1. **Evaluation of Mathematical Expressions**:
   - Input: Mathematical expressions in various formats
   - Output: Evaluated result of the expression

2. **Statistical Operations**:
   - Input: Lists of numbers or textual descriptions
   - Output: Calculated statistical measures

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error handling for invalid inputs

### Examples

- Evaluating Mathematical Expression: `calculate('2 * (3 + 4)')`
- Calculating Mean: `calculate('find mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5')`
- Finding Mode: `calculate('mode of 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5')`

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to enhance the functionality of the tool.
